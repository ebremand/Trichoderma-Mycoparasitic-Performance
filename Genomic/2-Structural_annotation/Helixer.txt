Helixer genome annotation

Genome annotation was performed using Helixer (version v0.3.4), an online deep-learning-based gene prediction tool.

Input data:
- Input file format: nucleotide FASTA
- Each genome was submitted only once

Parameters and options:
- Lineage-specific mode: Fungi
- GFF feature label name: strain_name 
- Output format: GFF

Job submission:
- Analyses were run via the Helixer web interface (https://www.plabipd.de/helixer_main.html)
