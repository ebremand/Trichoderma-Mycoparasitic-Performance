eggNOG-mapper functional annotation
==================================

Protein functional annotation was performed using eggNOG-mapper.

Tool
----
eggNOG-mapper version: v2.1.13
https://eggnog-mapper.embl.de/

Annotation procedure
--------------------
Predicted protein sequences (proteomes) were submitted individually to the
eggNOG-mapper web interface.

All analyses were performed using the default parameters provided by
eggNOG-mapper.


Input data
----------
- Input type: protein sequences (FASTA format)
- One proteome per submission

Output data
-----------
The following annotations were retrieved from eggNOG-mapper outputs and used
for downstream analyses:
- Functional annotations
- PFAM domains
