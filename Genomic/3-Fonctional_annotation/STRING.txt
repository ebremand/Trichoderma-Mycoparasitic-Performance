STRING functional annotation
============================

Protein functional annotation and Gene Ontology (GO) enrichment was
performed using STRING.

Tool
----
STRING version: 12.0
https://string-db.org/cgi/input?sessionId=bxXuCezaQVdK&input_page_show_search=on

Annotation procedure
--------------------
Protein sequences (predicted proteomes) were submitted to the STRING web
interface for functional annotation.

Only the Gene Ontology (GO) annotations were retrieved and used for
downstream analyses.

Input data
----------
- Input type: protein sequences (FASTA format)
- One proteome submitted per run

Output data
-----------
- GO terms associated with submitted proteins
- STRING protein identifiers and mappings for enrichment analyses
