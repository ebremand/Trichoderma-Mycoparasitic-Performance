dbCAN3 functional annotation
============================

CAZyme (Carbohydrate-Active Enzyme) annotation was performed online using dbCAN3.

Tool
----
dbCAN3 version: v12.0
http://dbcan-hcc.unl.edu/blast.php

Annotation procedure
--------------------
Protein sequences (predicted proteomes) were submitted to the dbCAN3 web
server for functional annotation.

The following databases/tools were used for each submission:
- The CAZy database via DIAMOND (E-value < 1e-102)
- dbCAN HMMdb via HMMER (E-value < 1e-15, coverage > 0.35)
- dbCAN-sub HMMdb via HMMER (E-value < 1e-15, coverage > 0.35)

Only CAZyme annotations detected by at least two of the three databases
were retained for downstream analyses to improve confidence.

Input data
----------
- Input type: protein sequences (FASTA format)
- One proteome submitted per run

Output data
-----------
The standard dbCAN3 outputs were retrieved and used for downstream analyses,
including:
- High-confidence CAZyme family assignments (detected by ≥2 databases)
- Functional annotation of predicted enzymes
- Identification of potential substrate specificities
